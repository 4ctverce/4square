        <div class="content">
            <h2 id="pred-hrou">Before the Game</h2>
            <p>Draw a 4x4m court on a flat surface with chalk and divide it into 4 equal squares. Number the squares 1, 2, 3, and 4 (1 Homeless, 2 Hotspot, 4 General, 3 King).</p>

            <h2 id="zakladni-pravidla" class="section-title">Basic Rules:</h2>

            <h3>Serving the Ball:</h3>
            <p>At the start of the game, the king serves the ball. The king must serve the ball so that it touches the ground only once (unless stated otherwise) and it first touches his field and then either another player or another player's field. If the king does not serve the ball first into his field, or it lands on the line or out of bounds, the game stops and the king gets a second chance to serve the ball correctly. If he fails the second attempt, the king dies.</p>

            <h3>The Ball Must Not:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fall on your field 2 times</li>
                <li>Fall on your field and then out of bounds</li>
                <li>Fall on your field and then immediately onto another player's field without your touch</li>
                <li>Fall on your field after your touch</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Player Must Not:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold the ball on the ground (with hands, feet, body)</li>
                <li>Touch the ball with hands more than once (Unless the king says otherwise)</li>
                <li>Break the rules given by the Constitution (unless the king says otherwise)</li>
                <li>Physically or mentally harm someone</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Player May:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold the ball in the air (AirTime)</li>
                <li>Touch the ball with their foot as many times as they want</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="cil-hry" class="section-title">Game Objective:</h2>
            <p>The goal of the game is to get to the king's field and stay there as long as possible. You advance to higher fields by eliminating any player with a higher position. For example, if I am on the homeless field and kill the king, the general moves up to king, the hotspot moves up to general, I (the homeless) move up to hotspot, and the first person in line moves up to homeless (if there is no line, then the one who died).</p>

            <h2 id="vyravy" class="section-title">Terms:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Retry - no one was eliminated in the round, and the round is repeated. This can happen, for example, when the ball lands on the line or there is a Double Bubble.</li>
                <li>On Yours - when the ball lands on player A's field after their touch. In such a case, player A dies.</li>
                <li>Double Bubble - if two (or more) players touch the ball at the same time and the ball falls out of bounds. If this happens, it is a Retry. If it happens that there is a Double Bubble of players A and B and the ball lands on player A's field, nothing happens, and player A can play the ball.</li>
                <li>Obstruction - a person (not currently in the game) who stands in the way of a player trying to save the ball. In such a case, it is a Retry.</li>
                <li>Blocking - when player A stands on player B's field and is between him and the ball. At this moment, player B cannot play the ball because of player A, so player A dies.</li>
                <li>Dribbling - This is a situation where player A plays the ball to player B's field, and after the first bounce on player B's field, player A touches the ball again, and without another touch, the ball falls on the same field. In this case, player A is out of the game.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="modifikace" class="section-title">Game Modifications:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>AirTime - AirTime is the ability to hold the ball while the player is in the air. The player must not catch the ball on the ground and then jump or catch the ball in the air and play it after landing. This modification is automatically allowed.</li>
                <li>Double Touch - the player can touch the ball twice (works with more touches, e.g., Triple Touch). This modification is automatically allowed only for girls.</li>
                <li>Circle - players must not stand in a circle in the middle of the field (about a 1m radius) before serving. This modification is not automatically allowed.</li>
                <li>ThreeSquare (Double Homeless) - a game type where only three players play. In this situation, the king has one field, the general has one field, and the hotspot and homeless are merged into one field. The player on this field has two touches because they have two fields.</li>
                <li>TwoSquare - a game type where only two players play. There are two versions of TwoSquare. Either you play on the whole field, and both players have two fields and two touches, or you play only on two fields, and the player has one field and one touch.</li>
                <li>All Star - this game is most often played by players with the rank of Expert or Professional. It is a game type where you do not try to get to a higher field but try to do the best tricks you can.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="sracky" class="section-title">Crap/Chicken Plays:</h2>
            <p>coming soon</p>

            <h2 id="prava-krale" class="section-title">King's Rights:</h2>
            <p>The king has the right to set any rule he wants. If other players do not know the rule set by the king, the king is obliged to explain this rule. The king must not set a rule that benefits only him or a small group of people he is a part of. The king must not set a rule that disadvantages any of the other players.</p>

            <h2 id="ranky" class="section-title">Ranks:</h2>
            <p><strong>Beginner:</strong> This rank is automatically given to a starting player after playing five rounds of the game. This player is obviously a beginner because he is not very good at the game, has no game strategy, and does not know the rules very well.</p>
            <p><strong>Intermediate:</strong> A player with this rank should be familiar with the game rules and be able to eliminate players with the same or higher rank. A player advances from beginner to this rank by completing 10 king speedruns in any amount of time and should be able to last at least 5 rounds on the king's field. If the player meets the conditions, the FourSquare commission will evaluate how the player plays and possibly grant him the title of Intermediate.</p>
            <p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Players with this rank show a higher level of skill than players at the Intermediate level but are not yet professionals. To achieve this rank, a player must complete 10 King Speedruns in one day, last at least 7 rounds on the king's field, and use various tactics to eliminate opponents. The FourSquare commission will evaluate the player's performance and possibly grant him the rank of Advanced.</p>
            <p><strong>Professional:</strong> This rank can only be given to players who fully understand the game and its rules. A player with the rank of Professional should be able to eliminate players with this or lower rank without any problems. A player advances from Intermediate to this rank by completing 10 king speedruns in one day, should be able to last at least 10 rounds on the king's field, should constantly use different tactics to eliminate players, and should have a game strategy. After meeting these conditions, the FourSquare commission will evaluate if the player plays at the level and possibly grant him the rank of Professional.</p>
            <p><strong>Expert:</strong> This rank is given only to the best players. These players should be able to eliminate any player. An expert has his own game strategy and his own chicken play. A player advances from Professional to this rank only if the commission approves it.</p>

            <h2 id="specialni-ranky" class="section-title">Special Ranks:</h2>
            <p><strong>Toddler:</strong> This rank is for players who are not good at the game at all, even when trying or training.</p>
            <p><strong>Outlaw:</strong> This rank is given to players who deliberately break the rules very often. With this rank, the player has disadvantages, such as receiving double the penalty for breaking the rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Snowflake:</strong> This rank is given to players who clean the foursquare court in winter for a long time without anyone asking them to. With this rank, you have the ability to throw snowballs at others.</p>
            <p><strong>Commission:</strong> This rank is only for members of the FourSquare commission. Three players with this rank have a greater say in the game than the king. This rank can only be obtained if the entire commission agrees.</p>
            <p><strong>Austrian Painter:</strong> This rank is given to a player after repeatedly painting the field (at least 10 times). The rank allows the player to choose the field at the start of the game and use the free field option.</p>
